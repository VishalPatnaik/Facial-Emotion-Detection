# Facial-Emotion-Detection

This project purposes a novel mood recognition system based on facial features.
There are two main processes in the proposed system, which are face detection
and facial expression recognition (FER). In facial expression recognition we
classify each facial image into one of the seven facial emotion categories and
also the detection of abnormal behavior. We can detect whether the crowd is
abnormal or not in particular scene, such as stampede, fight and panic. We
investigate how to involve temporal data, and how to transform a supervised
Fully Convolutional Neural networks (FCN) into an unsupervised one such that
the resulting FCN ensures abnormal behavior detection. Altogether, we propose
an FCN-based architecture for abnormal behavior detection in crowded scene
videos.
